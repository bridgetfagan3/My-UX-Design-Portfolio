          <p class="case-study-body">Zeit is a new company that wants to enter the unexplored market for time travel.
            However, users already have set patterns for how to navigate related travel websites. I integrated and
            practiced the UX design toolkit I learned through DesignLab’s UX Academy while building every step of
            this product with guidance from my mentor. Some of the challenges included maintaining
            usability and Zeit’s brand aesthetics across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
            Also, avoiding use of trip filter options that are confusing to users.

            <strong>How are travelers already planning their trips?</strong> <br>
            I conducted market research and a competitive analysis to learn more about strengths and weakness
            of current travel websites. Currently, <strong>The market’s largest segment is mobility services.</strong>
            Revenue is expected to show <strong>an annual growth rate of 7.8% by 2022</strong> and <strong>70% of people
            look at up to twenty reviews</strong> in the planning phase.

            <strong>User Interviews</strong> <br>
            To better understand the travel experience from the user’s point of view, I interviewed ten frequent
            travelers ages 29-27 years old.  First, I listened and took notes about their past travel and online
            booking experiences.

        users were saying, thinking, feeling, and doing when planning their travel adventures.  I looked for patterns
        and noticed that a few key ideas emerged with from the majority of the traveler interviews:

            <strong>Zeit User Persona</strong> <br>
            Using the insights and patters collected from the emapthy map, I created a user persona to to understand
            the major needs, goals, pain points, and motivations of the majority of users.

    </div>

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-body-process">
        A key aspect of the design for Zeit was developing an intuitive user flow and site navigation structure
        that allows travelers to easily browse, search, and filter for specific information.  An initial card sort
        activity with users and building a site map allowed me identify how the site navigation and categories could
        best be organized.  Then, I created a site map and user flow to understand how a Zeit user would navigate
        from an outside website to  booking their trip.

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-body-process">
        Now that the architecture had taken shape, I used sketching and wireframes to begin exploring how the interface
        would interact to create a visual focused experience for the users. In addition, I brainstormed different
        concepts for the logo that depicted a Zeit trip as a modern, adventurous, captivating experience.

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-body-process">
        Once the interaction wireframes and initial logo idea was ready, it was time to add color, typography,
        and interface elements that conveyed Zeit’s brand visually. Orange was used as a highlight color to reflect
        the energy and adventerous nature of Zeit’s trips.  The circular logo gives a feeling of movement that begins
        and ends with Zeit.  I put together a UI Kit in order to maintain consistenty with buttons, icons, headers, etc.

    </div>

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-body-process">
        The testing phase is the greatest opportunity to improve products by studying how people respond and interact
        with ideas.  I created high-fidelity updates of the wireframe with the new UI design.  The prototype in InVision
        had  clickable buttons, simulated page transitions and animations that roughly matched my experiential concepts
        for usability testing.

        <strong>Testing and Insights</strong> <br>
        After testing the prototype with users, I created an affinity map to sort, prioritize, and rank the user
        testing feedback.  High priorities for the next iteration included adding the trip length and price on the
        product page.  In addition, I highlighted the drop down arrows on the homepage search component.

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-title2">WHAT I LEARNED</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-case-study-div">
      <p class="case-study-body-process">
        The Zeit e-commerce travel website was one of my first iterations through a design project from research
        to prototype and user testing.  I learned a lot about myself and the UX process throughout this project.
        Here are a few of my takeaways after working on Zeit: <br><br>

        1. <strong>Take the time to think through research questions, goals, and planning at the beginning.</strong><br>
           This saves time in the long run; how effective will your product and design be for users if you aren’t addressing the correct issues?<br>
        2. <strong>Well-crafted questions</strong> can get to the heart of what users feel and think during an online experience.<br>
        3. <strong>Time management</strong> is essential for staying within the scope of the project.<br><br>
        <strong>Success and Challenges</strong> <br>
        This was my first project designing a UI kit and I found it to be an effective way of remaining consistent
        with elements and design styles throughout the design process.  It also saved time and helped me keep the style
        and feel of ZEIT’s brand in mind while working on the interface. <br><br>
        One of the most difficult but rewarding part of the project was completing a high-fidelity, functioning
        protype to test with users. Aligning the visual personality and brand of Zeit with the functionality that
        users needed was a challenge that pushed me as a designer.  Focusing on my feedback and insights from user
        research helped me make design decisions and kept me on track throught the process. <br><br>
        <strong>Moving Forward</strong> <br>
        For another iteration, I would update the prototype based on feedback from more recent user testing.
